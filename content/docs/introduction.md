# Welcome to Our Documentation

This is the main documentation site built with Next.js and Markdown support.

## Features

- **Automatic Navigation**: Files are automatically added to the sidebar based on folder structure
- **GitHub Flavored Markdown**: Full support for tables, code blocks, and more
- **Copy Code Blocks**: Linux code blocks have automatic copy buttons
- **Responsive Design**: Works on all devices

## Getting Started

To add new documentation:

1. Create a new `.md` file in the `content/docs` folder
2. The file will automatically appear in the navigation
3. Use standard Markdown syntax

## Code Example

Here's a simple Linux command:

```bash
ls -la
cd /home/user
mkdir new-folder
```
